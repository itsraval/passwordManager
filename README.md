All data will only be saved on local store in "C:\passwordManager".

## File

### File Location
The package of the java files is "src.passwordManager".
If you do not want to save the storage account files in "C:\passwordManager" you can change it at line 19 of the Main class. (and at line 69 of the Features class because you need to change the path for the README.txt file too, to prevent error).
